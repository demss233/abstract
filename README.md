# Abstract
An electron application that uses [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) to download an abstract image with some text on it. 

 - Abstract background images are fetched from [Api-Ninjas's Random Image API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomimage)
 - First clone the repository
 - Just go to [Api-Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/) and create your account, get your API KEY and test this electron application
 - Paste the api key in the handleClick function inside <mark>main.jsx</mark> file in <mark>/abstract/pages/</mark>
 - don't forget to use 'npm install' and 'npm run dev' ðŸ¦§
